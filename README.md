# The Color of Love - UBC Data Visualization (CPSC 447) 
## Project by: Guramrit Bamrah, Chinenye Oluka, Kamsiyochi Oramasionwu

With the evolving dating scene in the 2020’s, it’s getting more difficult to find a romantic partner that might be the one. Using the data collected in the <a id="study-link" href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017">How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017</a> study, we hope our visualization helps you understand some of the factors that could affect important aspects of a relationship including its overall quality! Hover and click through our visualizations to explore interesting dependencies between age, sex habits, religiousness, and race.
